===============

Recode of Bernard Demiaux's colour installation piece, Feu. Programmed in BASIC in 1978. This work was done as part of the Recode
Project and Processing Paris Sessions #05


ALGORITHM

1). Conceptual Stage
In this first stage, the artist sketches out basic forms and defines the necessary graphic elements for the work.

2). Second Stage
Setting up the formal computer language and paramaters necessary: defining size / colour / behavior. 
If necessary going back to stage one.

3). Artist/Mini Computer Dialogue
The program will process the data and suggest combinations for the artist. As a function of his/her
investigations, the artist will choose to explore one path of testing rather than another.
In exploring a path, the artist will have new ideas which may or may not be introduced in to the data set.

4). Fourth Stage
A synthesis by the artist of the different possibilities of the third stage, choosing one or continuing
to investigate the system.
